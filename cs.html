                    Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics to solve problems beyond classical computers' capabilities. Utilizing qubits, which can represent multiple states simultaneously, quantum computers can process complex problems exponentially faster. This technology is still developing, with significant investments from major companies, and is projected to become a $1.3 trillion industry by 2035, promising breakthroughs in various fields including medicine and machine learning.

                    The article provides essential tips for crafting an effective resume, emphasizing key sections such as contact information, a summary, education, experience, and skills. It highlights the importance of clarity and formatting, noting that employers typically spend only 30-60 seconds reviewing resumes. Additionally, it suggests showcasing measurable achievements rather than merely listing duties to enhance appeal to hiring managers.

                    Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of computers or robots to perform tasks typically associated with intelligent beings, such as reasoning and learning. Since the 1940s, digital computers have been programmed for complex tasks like mathematical proofs and chess. While no AI can match human flexibility across all domains, some programs excel in specific areas, achieving expert-level performance in applications like medical diagnosis and voice recognition
